### 7. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
**Functions:** `train_svm`, `predict_svm`
- Linear SVM classifier for audio classification tasks.
- Uses `sklearn.svm`.
- Input: Flattened audio features.

### 8. Subband Neural Networks for Multi-Band Audio Processing
**File:** `SubbandNN`
- A neural network model for processing subband audio signals.
- Architecture:
  - Separate neural networks for each subband.
  - Linear layers with ReLU activation.
- Input: Subband features.

### Performance Evaluation
**Function:** `evaluate_classification_model`
- Evaluates the performance of classification models.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- Input: Model, test data, and labels.

### Example Usage
The `main` function provides example usage for the models:
- Instantiates CNN, RNN, and Transformer models.
- Evaluates each model using dummy data.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- hmmlearn

### Running the Code
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the `main` function to test the models:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Notes
- Replace the dummy data in `main` with actual preprocessed audio data for real use cases.
- Adjust model parameters as needed based on the specific dataset and task.
